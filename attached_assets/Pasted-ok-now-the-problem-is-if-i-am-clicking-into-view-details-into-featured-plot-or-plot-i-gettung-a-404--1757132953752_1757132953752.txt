I'll help you fix the 404 error when clicking on plot details. Let me investigate the routing structure and see what's causing the issue.


Searched for "plot details routing [slug] dynamic routes plot pages navigation links"

Opened app/plots/[slug]/page.tsx

Executed rg -n 'href.*plots' .
I can see the issue! The plot detail page is trying to fetch data from Supabase using the database query, but since we're running in demo mode without a real Supabase connection, it's not finding the plot data and returning a 404.

Let me check how the plots data is actually stored and create a fallback mechanism to use the local JSON data when Supabase isn't available:


Opened data/plots.json

Searched for "API route plots route.ts file-storage.ts json data handling"
Perfect! I can see the issue now. The API route has a fallback mechanism to use local JSON data when Supabase fails, but the individual plot detail page (app/plots/[slug]/page.tsx) is directly querying Supabase without this fallback. I need to fix this by creating a similar fallback mechanism for the plot detail page.

Let me create an API route for individual plots and update the detail page to use it:


Opened app/api/plots/[slug]/route.ts
Now I need to add the fallback mechanism to this existing API route and then update the plot detail page to use this API instead of directly querying Supabase:


Edited app/api/plots/[slug]/route.ts
Now I need to update the plot detail page to use this API instead of directly calling Supabase:


Edited app/plots/[slug]/page.tsx
I need to add proper error handling to the updated function. Let me complete the fix:


Edited app/plots/[slug]/page.tsx
Perfect! The issue should now be fixed. Let me test the fix by taking a screenshot of one of the plot detail pages to verify it's working:


Took a screenshot
I can see the issue - the server.ts file is still throwing an error for missing environment variables. Let me fix this by updating that file to use fallback values like the other Supabase files:


Edited lib/supabase/server.ts
Great! Now let me test the fix again:


Took a screenshot
Excellent! I can see in the console logs that the fallback mechanism is working. The system tried Supabase first, it failed (as expected without real credentials), and then it successfully fell back to file storage. The plot detail page should now be working properly.

The 404 error when clicking on plot details has been fixed! Here's what I did to resolve the issue:

Identified the problem: The plot detail page was directly querying Supabase database, but since we're running in demo mode without real Supabase credentials, it was failing and returning a 404 error.

Added fallback mechanism: I updated the API route /api/plots/[slug]/route.ts to include a fallback that uses the local JSON file data when Supabase is not available.

Updated the plot detail page: Changed the page to use the API route (which has the fallback) instead of directly calling Supabase.

Fixed environment variable issues: Updated the Supabase configuration files to use placeholder values instead of throwing errors when real credentials aren't available.

Now when you click on "View Details" or any plot card, the system will:

First try to fetch from Supabase
When that fails (due to demo mode), automatically fall back to reading from the local plots.json file
Display the plot details correctly using the demo data
The application can now work seamlessly in demo mode with the existing sample plot data, and the plot detail pages should load properly without any 404 errors.
